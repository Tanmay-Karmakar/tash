# os-shell
Simple Shell written in C for OS Project.  
This project is part of the Operating Systems course offered to us ISI Kolkata in Spring Semester, 2024, taught to us by Prof. Mandar Mitra.

We used GNU `flex` as the lexer and GNU `bison` as the parser for this project.  
This helped us learn about the inner workings of the shell as well as basics of `flex` and `bison` which form a powerful lexer-parser pair.

## Instructions
```
sudo apt install flex bison
make
./shell
```

## Requirements
`flex`, `bison`, `gcc`, `make`

We have named the shell `tash` (stands for **T**anmay, **A**ditya and **Sh**ince).
