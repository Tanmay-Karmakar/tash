# os-shell
Simple Shell written in C for OS Project.  
This project is part of the Operating Systems course offered to us ISI Kolkata in Spring Semester, 2024, taught to us by Prof. Mandar Mitra.

We used GNU `flex` as the lexer and GNU `bison` as the parser for this project. This helped me learn about the inner workings of the shell as well as basics of `flex` and `bison`.

## Instructions
```
sudo apt install flex bison
make
./shell
```

## Requirements
`flex`, `bison`, `gcc`, `make`
